An AI-powered Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that reads a PDF CV, analyses it against a specific job role, and outputs a structured HR report in JSON format. 

## 🧠 My Learning Journey
**This is my very first API integration project!** I am currently a first-year university student studying Computer Science with AI in the UK. I built this to transition from theoretical coursework to practical backend engineering. 

Through building this, I learned how to:
* Connect to external APIs (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash).
* Hide sensitive API keys using `.env` files and environment variables.
* Build a dynamic Command Line Interface (CLI) using Python's `argparse`.
* Extract and process unstructured data from PDFs.
* Prompt engineer an LLM to return strictly structured data (JSON).
* Track API token usage (FinOps/Cost tracking).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **Libraries:** `google-genai`, `pypdf`, `python-dotenv`
